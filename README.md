## Contribution
The `spellchecker` library has deprecated dependencies like `indexed`, which don't run on python3. Change up the code, so it runs on a different nlp/word processing library (eg. Textblob, LanguageTool etc.) facilitating all the functions already made.
Feel free to add to the functionality, with supporting code.
